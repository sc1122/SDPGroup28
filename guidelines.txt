Guidelines for commiting and pushing changes:
	- Commit message must state what changes made
	- DO NOT commit to master branch before you have gone through the QA process 
	  and has the all clear from the rest of the group
	- If working on isolated issue/feature make a new cloned branch first
	- Ensure that files are stored in appropriate locations
	- Use pre-defined naming conventions and documentation guidelines.
